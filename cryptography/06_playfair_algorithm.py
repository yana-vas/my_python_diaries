"""
The Playfair cipher is a method of encryption that uses a 5x5 matrix of letters (known as a "tableau") to encode messages. It is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, meaning that it uses multiple substitution alphabets to encode the message.

To encode a message using the Playfair cipher, the following steps are taken:

Create a 5x5 matrix of letters, with the letters of the alphabet arranged in it. If the keyword is given, use it to fill the matrix, otherwise use the regular alphabet.
If the message contains any repeated letters that are not separated by a space, insert an "X" between them.
If the message has an odd number of letters, add an "X" to the end.
Divide the message into pairs of letters (known as "digrams"). If a pair consists of the same letter, insert an "X" between them.
For each digram, find the positions of the two letters in the matrix. If both letters are in the same row, replace them with the letters to their right (wrapping around if necessary). If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters below them (wrapping around if necessary). If the letters are in different rows and columns, replace them with the letters on the same row but in the columns of the other letter.
Repeat this process for each digram in the message.
To decode a message that has been encoded using the Playfair cipher, the same process is followed, except the substitution is reversed (i.e. the letters are replaced with the letters they were originally replaced with). This effectively "undoes" the encoding process, allowing the original message to be recovered.
